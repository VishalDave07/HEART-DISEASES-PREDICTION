# About Dataset

This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.

---------------
Scenario:
You have just been hired as a Data Scientist at a Hospital with an alarming number of patients coming in reporting various cardiac symptoms.
A cardiologist measures vitals & hands you this data to perform Data Analysis and predict whether certain patients have Heart Disease.
We would like to make a Machine Learning algorithm where we can train our AI to learn & improve from experience. 
Thus, we would want to classify patients as either positive or negative for Heart Disease.


---------------
Goal:
Predict whether a patient should be diagnosed with Heart Disease. This is a binary outcome.
  Positive (+) = 1, patient diagnosed with Heart Disease
  Negative (-) = 0, patient not diagnosed with Heart Disease
Experiment with various Classification Models & see which yields greatest accuracy.
Examine trends & correlations within our data
Determine which features are most important to Positive/Negative Heart Disease diagnosis
