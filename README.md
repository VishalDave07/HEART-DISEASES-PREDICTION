# Problem Statement
Among various life-threatening diseases, heart disease has garnered a great deal of attention in medical research. The diagnosis of heart disease is a challenging task, which can offer automated prediction about the heart condition of patient so that further treatment can be made effective. The diagnosis of heart disease is usually based on signs, symptoms and physical examination of the patient. There are several factors that increase the risk of heart disease, such as smoking habit, body cholesterol level, family history of heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and lack of physical exercise.

# Scenario:
You have just been hired as a Data Scientist at a Hospital with an alarming number of patients coming in reporting various cardiac symptoms.
A cardiologist measures vitals & hands you this data to perform Data Analysis and predict whether certain patients have Heart Disease.
We would like to make a Machine Learning algorithm where we can train our AI to learn & improve from experience. 
Thus, we would want to classify patients as either positive or negative for Heart Disease.


# Goal:
Predict whether a patient should be diagnosed with Heart Disease. This is a binary outcome.
  Positive (+) = 1, patient diagnosed with Heart Disease
  Negative (-) = 0, patient not diagnosed with Heart Disease
Experiment with various Classification Models & see which yields greatest accuracy.
Examine trends & correlations within our data
Determine which features are most important to Positive/Negative Heart Disease diagnosis


# Files: 
    Predicting Heart Disease with Classification Machine Learning Algorithms description.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) version  
    Predicting Heart Disease with Classification Machine Learning Algorithms.py - the Python (.py) version project
    Heart_disease_data.csv - Original dataset used from Kaggle.com in CSV (.csv) format   


# About Dataset
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
